👀 I’m interested in pursuing a career in CA (Chartered Accountancy), digital marketing, and entrepreneurship.
🌱 I’m currently learning CA Foundation subjects and working as an intern at NixSecura, handling digital marketing responsibilities independently.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to finance, digital marketing, and startups.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me via my LinkedIn profile or by email (if you have it).
